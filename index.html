         <p> Made for UT students by UT students. We felt students' universal panic from having to scramble to curate next year's roommates and which apartment complex to live in just a few months into the semester.
         </p>
         <p> Having to rigourously search online for which complex fits all your roommates' (if you even have that figured out!) needs while also dealing with UT's courseload is a harrowing task. </p>
